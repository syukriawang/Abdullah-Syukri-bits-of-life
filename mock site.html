    <p><center>Hello, my name is ABDULLAH SYUKRI BIN AWANG @ AWANG KHALID. Thank you for coming to my website. I would like to tell you guys something about myself, feel free to read and enjoy. First and foremost, I am creating this website as a individual project for my IMD311 individual assignment. My task is to create a personal website about myself using my own creativity. There are few things I would to share such as my favourite books, music and games that i play to spend my free time.</p>
    <p>In addition, I'd want to express my gratitude to my beloved lecturer, Madam Razifah Othman. I understand how difficult it is for both of us during the pandemic, but with your thoughtfulness of postponing the submission deadline, I am able to complete this project on time. I also want to apologize to Madam Razifah Othman for the late delivery of my project. Also, I'd want to thank all of my friends who assisted me in finishing this project by encouraging and instructing me in depth about coding.</p><center>

    <p><strong>My Books</strong>
    <p>There are some different types of books that i like to read during my university life. the type that i was talking about is a Webnovel which is similar to normal malay books but only that it is published online hence the name webnovel. At first i don't really like webnovel very much mainly because it is compromise of fully english words as i usually read malay horror books. When i started reading webnovel there are many new and bizarre words that are not usually seen and that usually prompt me to search for the meaning of the words. After i have start reading the books i really enjoys the various genre that is offered by webnovel and although there are some not good genre most of them are enjoyable to read. Sometime i even imagined myself as one of the characters which increased my immersion towards the books. Unsuprisingly, despite the saying that books are good for health i noticed i started to put up weight and my health is deteriorating. as the saying goes too much good things without supervision usually leads to poisoning. </p>
    <p> After i started reading webnovel i started reading various malay books that i usually feel bored when reading it in the past, i use the technique that i use when reading webnovel and that is immersion and it suprisingly helps a lot for me. Here are some pictures that I would like to show you about the books that i read after i start reading the webnovel.

    <h3 class="w3-center w3-padding-48"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Favourite Music</span></h3>
    <p><center> Music is more than just a sound to me as it helps me with a lot of things. Everytime i hear a music i feel like i can get better as in my life there are a lot of time when i feel deppressed, and only by hearing music can i feel myself getting better. But i also hear music just to enjoy myself because it helps increase my moods. One of my favourite artist is Bruno Mars, because his voice is usually a chill type voice that can calm my heart and most of his song are also very catchy. The latest song that I like from he is "Leave The Door Open". Other than that, I really like rap music from our underground Malaysian Rapper Ical Mosh. His Songs that i have heard mostly talk about the lower strata of the society in Malaysia and various difficulty that they have to faced.

    <p> The video that you can see above is my new favourite music during this time by Bruno Mars "Leave The Door Open". As you can hear the song are really chill and his voice really give me goosebumps sometimes because it's really unique and wonderful. I like him since my primary year and until now he never fail to make me feel happy.

    </video>
    <p> This one is my favourite underground rapper artist from Malaysia which goes by Ical Mosh, and his song 'Kunci'. His song really hits me hard because it makes me realize that i feel that my life is caged. This is just one of my personal favourite ♥

    <h3 class="w3-center w3-padding-48"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Games</span></h3>
    <p><center>Other than reading books during my free time, I also play some games from my PC or mobile such as Black Desert, GTA V, Mobile Legends and The Raft. This games that I play are mostly about strategy gameplay and games that use a lot of skills and game sense. Sometimes this games makes me so stressful because of various factors, but i usually stops playing when that happens. Right now during this pandemic I put my focus on pushing my rank at Black Desert because I already spent my money around Rm1k at the moment. </p>

    <p><center>Some people said that playing games is just a waste of time and money but for me playing games enables me to know about people all around the place and  i can al increase my knowledge about strategy and  according to the scientist playing games improve your analytical abilities because some of the games that I played is where you really need to use our brain to win or you'll lose. but most of all games are something to enjoy or else the game will not be fun if you make it hard. And this types of games are the really competitive type and it is for everyone to achieve the highest rank and climb the board. </p>
    <p>That's all about me, and before you guys click the "X", let's take a look at my family  when we all managed to get together. I really wanna appreciate my family because of how much help they have been in my life♥</p>
